# Java-Console-Based-Budgeting-System
An early version of a high school project that: determines the users annual tax from multiple categories (FICA, State Income Tax, Federal Income Tax, and City Income Tax), Shows a detailed summary of the tax break down, allows the user to create a budget and modify it, estimate total money at retirement based on savings, and saves the budget for future use so that the user can end the program and access the budget when he or she runs the program again. (All of this is java console based, A new version of this will include a more user friendly GUI)
